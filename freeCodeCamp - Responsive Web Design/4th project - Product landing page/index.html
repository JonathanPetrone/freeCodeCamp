    <section id="our-history">
      <h2>Our history</h2>
      <p>Fresh Oranges started with a passion for oranges and a commitment to quality that began with our founder, Maria. Growing up in a small farming community, Maria developed a love for fresh produce at a young age. Her family's orange orchard was her favorite place to spend time, and she quickly learned the secrets to cultivating the sweetest, juiciest oranges.</p>
<br>
<p>
After graduating from college, Maria set out to share her love of oranges with the world. She began by selling her oranges at local farmer's markets, and soon, her customer base grew to include grocery stores and restaurants.</p>
<br>
<p>As her business expanded, Maria remained committed to her principles of sustainability and ethical farming practices. She worked closely with local farmers to ensure that her oranges were grown using natural methods, without the use of harmful pesticides or chemicals.
